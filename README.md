# SunRunr

SunRunr Project Overview

- The SunRunr application is an IoT enabled web application for monitoring outdoor fitness activities, sun exposure, and weather conditions during those activities.

- Users will carry a device with a GPS and a UV sensor to monitor user-defined activities and sun exposure. When a user starts an activity, the device will periodically collect the GPS location, speed, and measured UV exposure.

- A third party weather service should further be used to track the temperature and humidity during each fitness activity.  
  When the activity is stopped, the collected activity is transmitted to a web server that maintains the history of each activity for the user.
- The SunRunr web application will also allow the user to monitor their fitness activities, UV exposure, and calories burned. The web application should use responsive design to allow users to view the web application on mobile devices.
